The following timers shall be a partition of the runtime without overlap or
gaps:

ghostcomm       communication/packing to update direct/indirect ghosts
ghostfill	interpolate/average/copy not counting communication
advance		clawpack advances the solution on grids
tagging		compute indicators, mark patches
adapt		fclaw2d_domain_adapt
rebuild		interpolate/average/copy after regrid, ghost memory alloc
partpack        pack/unpack data for partitioning
partition       fclaw2d_domain_partition
