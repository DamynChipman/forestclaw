The following timers shall be a partition of the runtime without overlap or
gaps:

ghostcomm       communication/packing to update direct/indirect ghosts
                     -- only ghost fill

ghostfill	interpolate/average/copy not counting communication
advance		clawpack advances the solution on grids
tagging		compute indicators, mark patches
adapt		fclaw2d_domain_adapt
                       -- just this function
rebuild		interpolate/average/copy after regrid, ghost memory alloc
partpack        pack/unpack data for partitioning
partcomm        Additional partition communication
partition       fclaw2d_domain_partition
                       -- just this function

How do we report timing statistics?

For each of the above counters each processor shall report say
a_i = total_runtime_ghostcomm / #local_grids_advanced etc.

In addition it will be helpful to report #local_grids_advanced itself.

Finally we do the parallel computation of statistics.
For weak scaling we report the average or maximum of a_i over all cores.
For strong scaling we report the same for a straight line over cores,
or the max_i a_i * max_i #local_grids_advanced_i for one that goes down,
or the inverse of it for a line that goes up.  The maximum takes in
variations in the most pessimistic way possible.

The timers' values to report is .cumulative.
In the statistics structure sc_statinfo_t the most useful output fields are
.sum_values, average, min, max, standev_mean.
