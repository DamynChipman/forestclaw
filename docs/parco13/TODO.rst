Stuff To Address
================
 
 * TODO: Edges? (reviewer didn't elaborate)

 * The underlying equations are known to Forestclaw: How is is the information
   shared with p4est (equation dependent refinement criteria, refinement and
   coarsening strategies (interpolation, integration).

 *  In example 2; what are the minimum and maximum levels of
   refinement and grid resolution for the spherical ball? If they are as same as
   the numbers in example 1, please indicate that in the paragraph that starts
   with “In both examples” on page 5.
