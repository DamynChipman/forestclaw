\begin{abstract}
%
We present a new hybrid paradigm for parallel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
that combines the scalability and lightweight architecture of tree-based AMR
with the computational efficiency of grid-based solvers for hyperbolic
conservation laws.  The key idea is to interpret each leaf of the AMR hierarchy
as one uniform compute patch in $\sR^d$ of dimension $m^d$, where $m$ is
customarily between 8 and 32.  Thus, computation on each grid can be optimized
for speed, while we inherit the flexibility of adaptive meshes.  In our work we
choose the p4est AMR library as mesh backend since it allows to compose the
mesh from multiple mapped blocks, thus enabling us to work with the cubed
sphere and other nontrivial multiblock geometries.
