## This variable should list the .h and .H files from the source tree that
## should be installed in the "include" directory.
## include_HEADERS += -I$(AMR_WAVEPROP) -I$(AMR_WAVEPROP_FORTRAN)

## The first part of the variable, "solver," must refer to a library or a
## program that is to be built.  That is, a target file that itself has
## been mentioned in bin_PROGRAMS for example.  Any variable used with +=
## must also first be initialized with = (usually to empty).
