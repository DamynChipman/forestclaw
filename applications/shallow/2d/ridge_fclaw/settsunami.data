Notes:

sealevel       used to initialize h in a steady state
drytolerance   h < drytolerance is handled as dry land

wavetolerance  abs(h-sealevel) > wavetolerance signals wave needing refinement
               Refinement might or might not be done based on specification
               of allowed and forced refinement regions in other data files.

depthdeep      cutoff for deep water
maxleveldeep   max refinement level allowed in deep water
               Regions where h > depthdeep can only be 
               refined to level maxleveldeep.  

ifriction      1 ==> next line contains Manning coefficient
               0 ==> no friction
               (future plans:  spatially varying friction)
coeffmanning   Manning coefficient for friction
frictiondepth  friction source term only applied in cells for h < frictiondepth
