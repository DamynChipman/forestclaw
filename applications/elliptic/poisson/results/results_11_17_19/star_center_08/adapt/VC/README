These runs used mx=8, which appears to be much too slow to really use effectively. 

Note that the last run (eff. res = 2048) took over 14 hours and still did not finish. This may have been because we were also computing the error at the same time.  

These timing results compare well with those done on 11/18 when error was not computed.
