[ForestClaw](http://www.forestclaw.org) is a parallel, multi-block adaptive finite volume code based on the
wave propagation algorithms in ClawPack (R. J. LeVeque, Univ. of Washington),
and the parallel, scalable octree infrastructure in p4est (Carsten Burstedde,
Univ. of Bonn).

A distinguishing feature of ForestClaw is the fact that the multi-resolution
grid hierarchy is not stored as overlapping, nested grids as is conventionally
done in block-structured Cartesian grid codes, but rather as a composite
structure of non-overlapping fixed sized grids which are stored as leaves in a
forest of quad- or octrees.  The basic adaptive algorithm that we use does not
differ in any fundamental way from that proposed by Berger and Oliger (JCP,
1984).

ForestClaw is free software under a BSD-style license (see COPYING).
The p4est library is released under the GPL 2.0 (or later).  As it is generally
linked with the forestclaw code, binary distribution falls under GPL as well.
